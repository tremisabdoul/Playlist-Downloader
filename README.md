##Using the script:<sub>
	You must write on a file called "music_list.txt" the list of your musics (1 line = 1 music) Converters exists to convert any playlists to a file
		For exemple i used https://www.chosic.com/spotify-liked-songs-organizer/ to convert my liked songs into an playlist
		https://www.tunemymusic.com to convert my playlist to an CSV file
		and i modified this csv to make it look like ("Liked Songs.png")
		if you change the extension of the file to txt i looks like the current "music_list.txt"
	Then you have to run "Playlist Downloader.py" wich would save your musics on the "Have a nice day buddy" folder
	When the script would end you will found all the musics that havn't been downloaded on "musics_not_found.txt"
